NCDC (Ngeria centre for disease control): the primary data was gotten from NCDC in the form of PDF.

### Tools
- Excel: data cleaning & extraction
- Power BI: data visualization

### Data cleaning/preparation
the following task were performed
1. data searching
2. data loading and inspection
3. handling missing value
4. data cleaning and formatting

### exploratory data analysis
EDA involved exploring OUTBREK OF DISEASE IN NIGERIA to answer key question such as:
- number of death caused by these pathogen
- most affected state in Nigeria
- month of high incidence
- most affected age group
- how many laboratory are performing and non performing laboratory
- test type
- most effective preventive measure and their lack of acceptance by the public

  ### data analysis
  ```DAX
  SUM()
  IF()
  ```
  ### RESULT/FINDING
  the analysis result as summerized as follows:
  - the total number of confirmed caused by covid 19 in the year 2022 was 530k i.e from january to September 
  - the total of death from covid-19 in the same year was 6k
  - the total number of recovery was 515k

  - most people rejected the covid-19 vaccine due to conspiracy theory

    ### Recomendation
    - Public facilities should be equipped with  PCR machines
    - Training should be done for scientist in the public laboratory on importance of early diagnosis of viral infection
    - public health eduction should be done on advantage of vaccination in order to debunk conspiracy theory
    - more research should be done on my there was high rate of mpox incidence in the year 2022
    - more reseach should be done on cholera re-occurence

    ### limitation
    data gotten was not sufficient to cover the trend over many years
